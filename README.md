A simple, open-source messages app  for Android that can be used for basic needs.
This is a project made by using MIT App Inventor, a simple, easy-to-use way to make apps that actually work out of blocks from programming languages like Scratch.
If you like the work, make sure to share this app using the downloaded file. This app will be available on the Play Store eventually.
